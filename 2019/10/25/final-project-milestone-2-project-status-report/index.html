<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>Create a status report for your project. Write this status report as if you were trying to demonstrate to your manager at work that your team understands the scope of your project and is making satisfactory progress towards finishing it.</p>
<p>Your project should take the form of a narrative (a Word document is fine). I am not defining a specific structure for it, but it will probably need to be on the order of 1-3 pages, and should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A restatement of the goals of your project, highlighting any goals that have changed from the original prospectus.</li>
<li>A list of the project team members, and an explanation of their responsibilities</li>
<li>An explanation of how your team is collaborating: are your primarily meeting in person or online? Do you have internal deadlines? What does your git workflow look like? (See Chacon <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows">Chapter 3.4</a> for some simple workflow examples)</li>
<li>An explanation of the major challenges of the project, and a rough timeline for accomplishing them</li>
<li>A description of what progress you have made so far, including a link to the central github repository for the project
<ul>
<li>Note: I would like you to have a single “reference” github repository for your project that I will grade. Probably the easiest way to do this is to assign one member of the group as the owner of the reference repository, and allow others to contribute to this repo.</li>
</ul></li>
