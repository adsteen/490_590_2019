      <description>Resources The resources I&amp;rsquo;m listing are better than any notes I would post, so I refer you to them for this lesson.
 Software Carpentry&amp;rsquo;s git lesson As a reminder, Software Carpentry&amp;rsquo;s the Unix (bash) shell lesson Jenny Bryan&amp;rsquo;s extensive Happy git with R guide, which contains a lot of practical detail about setting up git and connecting it with GitHub. Some particularly important sections:  Philosophy and practical advice on git clients (like Git Kraken, which I&amp;rsquo;m using) Connecting to GitHub Setting up credentials for HTTPS so you can connect automatically  GitHub&amp;rsquo;s list of guides to get started with git and GitHub.</description>

      <description>DRAFT: I’ve posted this without explaining how to write methods for new classes. I’ll update shortly to include that.
Resources  This lecture was taken with minor changes from the Wickham Chapter 13 on S3 classes in Advanced R.   Classes and methods  There are two main reasons to use classes in R.  It allows you to create well-defined and structured data objects, so that you can be (reasonably) sure that an object of a given class will be structured in a specific way.</description>

      <description>StackOverflow (SO) is a great resource for help with R, or any other programming language. Below are two notes about how to use SO effectively.
 SO is complete enough that, when you are new to R, it is extraordinarily unlikely that you will have a question that has not already been asked already. So, before you post a question, spend quite a while searching for similar questions. If you are certain that you have a new question, great!</description>

      <description>Functions Create a function that does the following:
Accepts 3 arguments:  The first argument should be a data frame The second and third argument should be the index number of columns in the data frame. These should default to the first and second column of the data frame, respectively.  Returns a vector that is the sum of the two columns specified in the arguments Throws an informative error if:  The object passed in as the first argument is not a data frame Either of the two columns are not numeric, so they can’t be added  Auto-prints the result of the function, if it is not assigned to a value (just like most base R functions do).</description>

      <description>Linear models Using the mtcars data frame, create a linear model of qsec (quarter mile time in seconds) as a function of mpg (miles per gallon). qsec should be the dependant variable, and mpg is the independant variable. Use the coef() function to extract the coefficients Use the summary() function to view the coefficients Obtain the coefficients directly from the model object, using what you know about subsetting lists.  Use the base R plot() function to create four diagnostic plots of the linear model.</description>

      <description>Good style for writing ggplot code ggplot2 can be though of as building a plot from layers (data, then mappings, then geoms, etc…) so our code should reflect this.
Accordingly, we should write the code in a specific order:
ggplot() call geoms (note that each geom is plotted on top of the previous one) stats scales facets themes and ggtitle()  ggplot2 requires that the ggplot function comes first, but after that it will allow you to write the plot in any order.</description>

      <description>Style is substance Donald Knuth famously wrote &amp;ldquo;Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.&amp;rdquo; (Knuth, 1983, Literate Programming).
Accordingly, it is important to write our code so that it is easily readable by humans. What defines easily readable? Well, it helps for the whole community of readers to be working from a common set of rules.</description>

      <description>Data visualization theory  Read Healy chapters 1-4. Bring two plots you found in the primary literature (printed out, ideally)  One that you think succeeds in an interesting way One that you think fails in an interesting way For the one that fails: do a pen-and-paper sketch of how it might be improved. No need to be precise, the goal is just to communicate the gist of what a better version of that plot would look like.</description>

      <description>note The content of this lesson is taken from one of Software Carpentry&amp;rsquo;s R lessions
Some key points are noted below, but definitely look over that lesson (which we will continue to work from). This material goes a bit beyond what we covered in lecture 3. We will focus on creating plots the week of Sept 4, but we will come back to these basic operations as the semester progresses.</description>
